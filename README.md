# Nitro: A Decentralised Binary Options Exchange Protocol

*Nitro is a binary options exchange protocol that allows uses to trade binary options in a decentralized way.*

While the protocol may be unregulated, it is 100% transparent. Once a contract is deployed onto the blockchain it is tamper proof. All contract code will open-sourced and can be publicly verified, thus ensuring an environment of fair play.

Price data is sourced from reliable and verfiable third-party price oracles.
No need to provide any identifying personal information. The protocol is anonymous. All you need is a wallet address.
No need to deposit into a trading account and risk having your funds stolen. Crypto assets are traded directly to and from a compatible smart wallet.

Crypto is traded 24/7.
Assets can be any ERC-20 token with a reliable price oracle, of which there are hundreds.
The protocol can be interacted with directly on the blockchain as well as via the application homepage.
Democratic ownership and voting rights via governance tokens.
Earn governance tokens for using the protocol.
Profit is shared with the community.

In the DEBOX protocol, instead of providing liquidity to traders via a centralised bank account, liquidity is provided on-chain by Liquidity Providers (LPs) who stake tokens. Staking is the process of locking up tokens in a smart contract, providing liquidity to a protocol. Users who stake a given token earn interest, generating passive income. 

In the case of the DEBOX protocol, users can stake a certain token, for example, ETH. By depositing ETH into the liquidity pool via the smart contract, LPs enable options trading. When a trader calls incorrectly and is “out-of-the-money” the liquidity pool takes a profit. When a trader calls correctly and is “in-the-money” the liquidity pool loses profit.

Earn governance tokens

In the DEBOX protocol, the odds are always slightly in favour of the liquidity pool. This is essential to the success of the protocol as if not, the liquidity pool would slowly be drained of tokens. This would incapacitate the protocol as there would no longer be an incentive for liquidity providers and there would no longer be any liquidity to pay successful trades out of. As long as the odds are always slightly in favour of the house, while individual traders may receive big pay-outs, the liquidity pool will earn money in the long term.
